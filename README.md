#MoneyGrabbers

Imagine you're walking on a busy Manhattan street, totally devoid of any problems. You live a quiet life. Until now. Out of a sudden, you see an armored van crashing and a ton of coins start flying everywhere. Who doesn't want a piece of the pie? Welcome to MoneyGrabbers.

MoneyGrabbers is a local multiplayer game in which you compete with your friends to grab the largest amount of coins in the arena before the time runs out. For this you can steal from other players, while they try to steal from you. The game 7 rounds. Each round is 15 seconds long and in the end if you don't get out quickly, the cops will get you! You can also try to stay a few seconds long to try and open a bonus safe, but the longer you stay, the harder it is to get away.

To steal from other players you can either use a melee attack or use some of your coins as projectiles to hit them. In both cases this will make them drop some of their coins to floor.

One other feature from our game is that even though you win by having more coins than everyone else, between each round you can spend some of your already earned coins to unlock and upgrade your abilities.

The game is played with controllers and for up to 4 people.

This game was developed by a team of 4 during the course of Game Development Methodology in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, consisting in 3 programmers and 1 artist.
